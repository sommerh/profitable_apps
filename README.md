# profitable_apps

This is my first data engineer project, made with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. My previous projects are primarily written in Javascript, and focused on app development. 

My attached Jupyter Notebook takes you through data cleaning and analyzation of two datasets, which can be easily downloaded from [Kaggle](kaggle.com), with the goal of finding the most popular genre of free English-based apps.
