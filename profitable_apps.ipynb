    "- `Weather`: Generally, weather apps are looked at quickly so there would not be a lot of opportunity for in-app ads being profitable. Additionally, it would likely require access to connect to expensive APIs. \n",
    "- `Food & Drink`: Popular food-based apps revolve around a specific store that uses that app to sell their products. We are building an app, not a restaurant or physical service, so this wouldn't be helpful for us\n",
    "- `Finance`: These apps require specific financial knowledge, which would require us to hire an entire team dedicated to the financial side of the app. This is not a route we are interested in taking.\n",
    "- `Music`: The popular music apps are dedicated to downloading and listening to music, which would require some tier of payment for them to be profitable due to the cost of the music itself."
